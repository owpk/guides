The change which started with the JBoss AS7 and continues in WildFly is, the whole server configuration is hold in a single file. There are prepared some 4 default configurations (or profiles):

default (standalone.xml - used by default - without clustering and messaging)
HA (standalone-ha.xml - supports clustering)
Full (standalone-full.xml - supports messaging)
Full HA (standalone-full-ha.xml - supports both messaging and clustering)

To use the custom profile start the server with using -c switch

./standalone.sh -c standalone-full-ha.xml
